If you want to do some real fun with Python, then do check this space out. I did this when I was a beginner in Python and was exploring how easy, interactive and fun Python could be. 
I made some basic games : 
<ol>
<li> Dice Stimulator </li>
<li> Tic Tac Toe </li>
<li> Egg Catcher </li>
<li> Caterpillar Game </li>
</ol>

I had a lot of fun with Tkinter & Turtle Graphics. For those who don't know, turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes
by providing them with a virtual canvas and Tkinter is the GUI package. <br>

Found this old collection and thought of sharing it here!

Quick Update : Mar 17, 2023
Adding JenkinsFile to this Repo, for triggering build whenever there is a code change.
